# Chaos_game_fractal_generation
How to install:
Clone this repository

Purpose:
The purpose of this code is to be able to take any transformation matrix that represents a transition system and being able to generate regular fractals

Algorithm:
Dependecy: Pyplot and Random will be needed
Optional: math and numpy

Note: If you want try for any other kinds of transformation and other labelled transistion system, feel free to download the code and make changes to initialization values.
